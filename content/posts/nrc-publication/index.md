Just sharing a recent joint publication with the NRC that was recently published in [ACS Appl. Electron. Mater](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsaelm.9b00594). The work conducted demonstrates the potential of a new unipolar n-type material 3,7-Bis(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-bâ€²]difuran-2,6-dione Dicyanides in OFETs.
